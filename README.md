# smallcommunityPj

It is just my tiny work.

This project is about making "very" simple discord-like feed web but cannot use voice chatting only keyboard chatting available.

you can make your own chat room, can chat in chat room 



I used django framework for this small practice,

because I thought that django is pretty good and fast for developing message-board-website.





Also I used django virual enviornment because i heard somewhere that virutal enviorment reduces annoying version control efforts
